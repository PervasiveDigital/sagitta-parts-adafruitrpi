What you need is an add on prototyping Pi Cobbler from Adafruit, which can break out all those tasty power, GPIO, I2C and SPI pins from the 26 pin header onto a solderless breadboard. This set will make &quot;cobbling together&quot; prototypes with the Pi super easy. <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">Designed for use with Raspberry Pi Model B AND Model A, both revisions. This will not work with the Raspberry Pi 2 or Model A+ or B+</span> <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/products/2029\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">If you have one of those, check out our 40-pin version of this item.</span></a><br /></p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">The Pi Cobbler mini kit comes with a fully assembled PCB with socket and headers as well as a <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/products/862\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">26 pin ribbon cable</span></a> <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">No soldering required!</span> The cable plugs between the Pi computer and the Cobbler breakout.

The Cobbler PCB has all the pins labeled nicely so you can go forth and build circuits without keeping a pin-out printout at your desk. We think this will make it more fun to expand the Pi and build custom circuitry with it.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #914","fritzingModelIndex":"85430336","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"family":"Adafruit Pi Cobbler","fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Aug 27 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_fec4f8ac9e983c342c848d1bb30db27b_13"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_fec4f8ac9e983c342c848d1bb30db27b_14_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_fec4f8ac9e983c342c848d1bb30db27b_14_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_fec4f8ac9e983c342c848d1bb30db27b_14_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
