We really like the RGB Character LCDs we stock in the shop. (For RGB we have <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/products/399\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">RGB negative</span></a> and <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/products/398\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">RGB positive</span></a>.) Unfortunately, these LCDs do require quite a few digital pins, 6 to control the LCD and then another 3 to control the RGB backlight for a total of 9 pins. That's nearly all the GPIO available on a Pi!<br /><br />With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi!</span> The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus. This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #1109 #1110 ","fritzingModelIndex":"85430334","family":"Adafruit RGB LCD Pi Plate","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 26 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_99e366b95e24f4cd7b867b1fe6cde956_1"},"Tags":[]}
