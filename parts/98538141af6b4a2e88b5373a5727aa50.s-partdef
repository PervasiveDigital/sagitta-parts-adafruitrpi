It has the Cobbler baked right in. Simply solder the 2x13 pin header in and you get all the labeled breakouts with tons of prototyping space, power rails, mounting holes and that gorgeous silk.<br /><br />Customers have asked us to carry basic perf-board, but we never liked the look of most basic perf: its always crummy quality, with pads that flake off and no labeling. Then we thought about how people <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">actually</span> prototype - usually starting with a solderless breadboard and then transferring the parts to a more permanent PCB. That's when we realized what people would really like is a proto board that makes it easy!<br /><br />This proto-board is the PCB you always wish you had, but never realized it! We took the basic layout of a half-sized breadboard (the PCB has 30 rows) and turned that into a beautiful PCB. The top side has a white silkscreen, and the same markings you're familiar with, to make transferring components easy. The bottom has the 5-hole pad design that matches a classic breadboard, with 4 power bus lines on the sides, and no mask so you can easily cut traces when necessary. We used 1.2mm diameter drill holes so even parts with big leads will fit. All holes are <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">thru-plated for strength</span> - these wont peel off with rework. The finish is a gold plate - <span style=\" font-weight:600;\">you won't get oxidation like with bare copper perf</span>! There are also tons of mounting holes so you can attach the PCB to your project box.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #1148","fritzingModelIndex":"85430341","family":"Adafruit Raspberry Pi Perma Proto Half","variant":"variant 1","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Sat Aug 27 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_1bcdd87a263214f025989cf20c417f5b_2"},"Tags":[],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\adafruit_907a769088cb036a63e01d787fbe408a_8_breadboard.xaml","Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\adafruit_907a769088cb036a63e01d787fbe408a_8_schematic.xaml","Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\adafruit_907a769088cb036a63e01d787fbe408a_8_pcb.xaml","Layers":{}}}}
