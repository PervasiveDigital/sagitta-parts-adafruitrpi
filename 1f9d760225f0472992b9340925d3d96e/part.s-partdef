The Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet for Raspberry Pi is <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/3527\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">the big sister to our mini PiOLED add-on</span></a>. This version has 128x64 pixels (instead of 128x32) and a much larger screen besides. With the OLED display in the center, we had some space on either side so we added a 5-way joystick and two pushbuttons. Great for when you want to have a control interface for your project.</p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">These displays are small, only about 1.3&quot; diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This screen is made of 128x64 individual white OLED pixels and because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness!</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #3531","fritzingModelIndex":"85430348","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Jun 9 2017","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_d80b6e63752fc051288f914c04d9079b_1"},"Tags":[]}
