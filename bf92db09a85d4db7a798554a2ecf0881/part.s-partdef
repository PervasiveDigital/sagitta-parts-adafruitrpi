It has a grid of 0.1&quot; prototyping soldering holes for attaching chips, resistors, LED, potentiometers and more. The holes are connected underneath with traces to mimic the solderless breadboards you're familiar. There's also long power strips for +3V, +5V and Ground connections to the Pi. Near the top we break out nearly every pin you could want to connect to the Pi (#26 didnt quite make the cut).</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #2314 and #2310","fritzingModelIndex":"85430325","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit Perma-Proto HAT","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Tue Jul 12 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_e5fc1e5bc08fa729845c9b23012e9b81_1"},"Tags":[]}
