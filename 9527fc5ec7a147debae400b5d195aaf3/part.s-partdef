It features a 2.2&quot; display with 320x240 16-bit color pixels. The HAT uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top of your Model A+ or B+ and fits into our case quite nicely.<br /><br />It's designed to plug directly onto the Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+ or B+ . While not specifically designed for Pi Model A or B, <a href=\"https://www.adafruit.com/product/1658\"><span style=\" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;\">you can use it with A/B if you solder in an extra-tall 2x13 header (not included)</span></a> instead of the included 2x20 header </p>\n<p style=\" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;\">This design uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1) as well as GPIO #25. All other GPIO are unused and are available on a 25-pin long breakout line. Since we had a tiny bit of space, there's 4 flat tactile switches wired to four GPIOs, that you can use if you want to make a basic user interface. For example, you can use one as a power on/off button.</p></body></html>","Author":"ladyada","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"part number":"Adafruit #2315","fritzingModelIndex":"85430335","variant":"variant 1","family":"Adafruit 2.2in PiTFT HAT","layer":null,"fritzingVersion":"0.5.2b.02.18.4756","fritzingPartVersion":"4","fritzingDate":"Fri Aug 26 2016","fritzingModuleId":"adafruit_6d8f66a13bdcfd81cf83aa0dd9687113_1"},"Tags":[]}
