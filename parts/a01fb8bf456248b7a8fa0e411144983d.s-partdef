Capacitive touch sensing works by detecting when a person (or animal) has touched one of the sensor electrodes. Capacitive touch sensing used for stuff like touch-reactive tablets and phones, as well as control panels for appliances, which is where you may have used it before. This HAT allows you to create electronics that can react to human touch, with up to 12 individual sensors.","Author":"Dean Cording","Source":"Fritzing library 'Adafruit Raspberry Pi.fzbz'","Properties":{"fritzingModelIndex":"85430328","family":"hat","variant":"touch","fritzingVersion":"0.9.2b","fritzingPartVersion":"1","fritzingDate":"2015-07-14","fritzingModuleId":"Cap HAT"},"Tags":["adafruit","touch","MPR121","raspberry pi","hat"],"Views":{"breadboard":{"ViewType":"breadboard","ViewImageRef":"breadboard\\Cap_HAT.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":2.5590482,"NativeHeightInInches":2.1885204,"Layers":{}},"schematic":{"ViewType":"schematic","ViewImageRef":"schematic\\Cap_HAT.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":1.3,"NativeHeightInInches":1.9,"Layers":{}},"pcb":{"ViewType":"pcb","ViewImageRef":"pcb\\Cap_HAT.xaml","NativeWidthInInches":2.55906,"NativeHeightInInches":2.25866,"Layers":{}}}}
